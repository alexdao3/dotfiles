# Emacs Config Notes

Dev environment requirements:

- [x] solid movement (evil-mode or otherwise)
- [x] fast file search (helm)
- [x] fast file creation
- [x] file tree viewer
- [ ] project level search for string/regex
- [ ] jump to source of function (local or otherwise)
- [ ] quick view docs of function (local or otherwise)
- [ ] list uses of function in current project
- [ ] toggle test file for current file
- [ ] simple window split and movement between
- [x] fast auto-complete


# Package management

`use-package` seems to be the choice to wrap everything

`(setq use-package-always-ensure t)` will auto-download missing packages when I switch machines
