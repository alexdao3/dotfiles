* dotfiles/.emacs.d/lisp/todo.org
The place for emacs hopes and dreams.

This file houses emacs TODOs,
and features in-progress and mvp source blocks.

It generates the init-todo.el sibling file via `M-x org-babel-tangle`

* TODO never open file from nerd tree over *term* window
* TODO helm persistant actions from helm mini/projectile
* TODO other helm sources should have colors the way the buffer list does
* TODO resize windows with simpler commands (arrow keys)
* TODO page up and down term window from other buffers
* TODO alchemist find function across umbrella apps (don't know how to find ...)
* TODO kill buffers from helm mini
* TODO kill ansi-terms without asking
* TODO show always-terminal across bottom in projectile project root
* TODO toggle terminal full-screen, partial-screen, off-screen
* It should be easier to mix writing with CLI
If I want an iex shell anywhere, C-i,C-e,C-x (or C-{iex}) should work.

    iex> IO.inspect("Hello there, you worldy-you.")

Evaluating `C-{iex} = shell("iex")` should add the relevant keybindings
to my dotfiles, perhaps by prompting me.
* Variables should always display a commented version of their definition
...by default.

The editor needs to read every line as it's finished,
and print the output to a file.
Another buffer can re-load from disk.

It's like elm's state machine,
but in your editor.
