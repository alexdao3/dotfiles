* dotfiles/.emacs.d/lisp/todo.org
The place for emacs hopes and dreams.

This file houses emacs TODOs,
and features in-progress and mvp source blocks.
It generates the init-todo.el sibling file via `M-x org-babel-tangle`

* TODO fix term git-diff and glp printing
* TODO fix click-to-move-cursor (insert-cursor) in ansi-term
* TODO imenu refresh local menu on file save
* TODO helm-projectile: first source should be 'ansi-term' for that dir
* TODO helm ctrl-k or ctrl-p should wrap to bottom of source
* TODO evil repeat ring
* TODO open zshrc in a mode
* TODO clicking in ansi-term should move the evil-insert cursor (not just the normal) to that location
* TODO other helm sources should have colors the way the buffer list does
* TODO remove create buffer and directory prompts
* TODO fix elixir file/test toggle
* TODO never open file from nerd tree over *term* window
* It should be easier to mix writing with CLI
If I want an iex shell anywhere, C-i,C-e,C-x (or C-{iex}) should work.

    iex> IO.inspect("Hello there, you worldy-you.")

Evaluating `C-{iex} = shell("iex")` should add the relevant keybindings
to my dotfiles, perhaps by prompting me.
* Variables should always display a commented version of their definition
...by default.

The editor needs to read every line as it's finished,
and print the output to a file.
Another buffer can re-load from disk.

It's like elm's state machine,
but in your editor.
